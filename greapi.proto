// Recognition flow:
// 1) Start listening for acceleration, gyroscope and magnetometer data from the sensors
// 2) Create an ID for the session (UUID is recommended)
// 3) Store each x,y,z values into an SensorSample object
// 4) Store each SensorSample object into a list, appropriate for its type
// 5) Whenever you decide to send the data to the server for analysis construct the Acceleration, Gyroscope and Magnetometer objects
//    and pass to them the list of collected SensorSamples (Acceleration gets the acceleration samples, etc.)
// 6) Create a RecognitionRequest object and set its acceleration, gyroscope and magnetometer properties and send it to the server
// 7) Read the response of the server into the RecognitionResponse object
// 8) If the status of the response equals 'GestureEnd' then gestures have been recognized 
// 9) The labels property will hold the recognized gesture's labels. The type property will specify the type of the gesture (Motion or Rotational)
